          Honeycomb’s mission is to develop services, software and support for a future where wellbeing is an integral
          part of the school experience while guaranteeing privacy, security and sensitivity for the student in a way
          where, now and in the future, it cannot be used as an asinine metric that can be further exploited.

            <h3>Education’s relationship with data is wrong and unsustainable</h3>

            <p>As the use of technology and data collections grows in education and you can see the same mistakes appearing
                that are being made in their commercial and consumer counterparts.</p>
            <p>The motivation often originates from the same type of centralised entity; the government, head of a federation,
              head of an academy group or a head of school. Someone with a desire to make capturing and analysing data a
              seemingly easy way to assess performance in both teachers and students. </p>

        </div>
        
      
      <p>This, as we know in the consumer world, is a path to menial and time-consuming data input, gaming the system,
        losing sight of real value and exploitative data analytics. Data feeds into larger and larger funnels removing
        nuance and individuality at every step until it is used to justify a decision that affects millions of people’s
        lives. </p>
      <p>Especially as wellbeing becomes a bigger part of the school experience, which naturally will involve
        discussions around mental health, thought & feelings and extremely sensitive information that could be exploited
        in the same way.</p>

      <h2>How are we going to solve it?</h1>
        <p>We don’t know yet. The people at Honeycomb have a commercial & research background, with a desire to help
          support education. We want to listen to you; students, teachers and leadership, and learn about the problems
          as you see them to try and solve them with you. We want to conduct a research phase of 3 months to help
          understand what you need and have your invaluable input in this process.</p>
